    <h2>Hi! I’m Luqman, a second-year Software Engineering student at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)</h2>
    
    <p><strong>I have a deep passion for coding, problem-solving, and building innovative projects.</strong> My journey in software development has been exciting, as I explore web development, new technologies, and ways to improve my technical skills.</p>  
    
    <p>Beyond coding, <em>I’m a huge anime fan!</em> I love watching different genres, binge-watching series in one go, and exploring the artistic and storytelling aspects of anime. 
    <span style="color: blue;">Whether it’s classic series or the latest seasonal releases, anime is a big part of my free time.</span> I also enjoy engaging in extracurricular activities and spending time with my pets.</p>
